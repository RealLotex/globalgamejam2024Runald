- DESCRIPTION -

Get ready to escape from Runald!

In this thrilling 2D endless runner, you'll try to flee from a bad clown (not bad as in evil, just one who tells bad jokes). Your mission: dodge the clown and throw tomatoes, popcorn, and flip-flops to halt his pursuit!

- HOW TO PLAY - 

Use the cursor to move and avoid the clown's movements. By holding down the left click you will be able to grab the different objects and throw them quickly at the evil clown.
